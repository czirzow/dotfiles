Setup my zsh environment using a configuration tool instead of self made install scripts via 'bash'.  Due to the zsh change on the **macOS Catalina** i figured I should update my dotfiles. 

At the same time I figured I should also change how my install script works.

**MacOS: Catalina**:
Keep track of the changes.

Notes:
  - use puppet (or similar)
  - keep little legacy custom configs

Instructions:
 - install zsh (etc) [Oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/tools/install.sh).
 

**Earlier MacOS && Other**:
 - Move current config
 - Update documentation.
